About this library
--------------------
The **pyfluo** library enables easy and efficient manipulation of imaging data using a set of custom-built data structures and functions.

This project is `hosted on github <https://github.com/bensondaled/pyfluo/>`_.

Note that **pyfluo** is a work in progress; neither the code nor the documentation is complete. That said, it is already functional for a wide variety of tasks.

Requirements
--------------
The library has the following dependencies:
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* opencv
* pims (for tiffs)

Note that currently, only numpy, scipy, and matplotlib are enforced on installation of the package.

Installation
-------------
#. Download the project `here <https://github.com/bensondaled/pyfluo/>`_.
#. Extract and navigate to the root directory.
#. Run ``python setup.py install``

A quick example
-----------------
Here is a quick-start example to get you moving with pyfluo.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pyfluo import ROI, Tiff, Movie, Trace, compute_dff, pca_ica, comp_to_mask, save

    # create a movie from a tiff file
    mov = Movie('/Users/ben/PhD/data/mov.tif', Ts=0.03)

    # motion correct the movie
    mov = mov.correct_motion(n_iters=1)

    # convert the movie to delta f over f
    mov = compute_dff(mov, window_size=1.0, step_size=0.100)

    # play the movie
    mov.play(fps=30, scale=5, contrast=3)

    # manually select some ROIs
    roi = mov.select_roi(3)

    # or alternatively: use PCA/ICA to determine ROIs
    #comp = pca_ica(mov, components=12)
    #roi = ROI(mask=comp_to_mask(comp))

    # display the movie with its ROIs
    mov.project(show=True, roi=roi)

    # extract traces
    tr = mov.extract_by_roi(roi)

    # display traces
    tr.plot()

    # save the traces
    save('my_data', traces=tr)

Shown below are examples of the projected movie (left), and extracted traces (right).

Troubleshooting
------------------
A list of known fixes for common problems will be kept here.

* For windows installations, VisualStudio often causes problems in installing tiff-related modules. An example fix to such a problem is explained `here <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2817869/error-unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat>`_.
